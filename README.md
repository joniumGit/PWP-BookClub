# Setup

## Tools:

The project is not bound to any specific tools or workflows.

## Development:

Don't push to __master__, use __dev__ for development, or a feature branch.

Everything goes under code and every part has their own sub-folder under it e.g. [code/database](code/database)  
Also, everything should have their own __README.md__ e.g. *[code/database/__readme.md__](code/database/README.md)*

## Setting up the project

Each part of the project has their own readme and instructions on how to run them:

* [PWP Database](code/database/README.md)
